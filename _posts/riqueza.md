Wealth inequality is so much worse than most people realize, our current economic system is very broken and there's plenty of information that proves it. So, where to start?

[The ultra-rich have as much as $32 trillion hidden away in offshore accounts to avoid taxes.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth-idUSBRE86L03U20120722) As a way to understand the magnitude of the number 32 trillion (32,000,000,000,000), let's use time as an example. One million seconds is only 12 days, but one billion seconds is 31 years. So there's a massive difference between a million and a billion, much more than people realize. But how much is 32 trillion seconds? It's over a million years.

People know it's an issue but they don't understand just how extreme it can be. Here's an example: **If you had a job that paid you $2,000 an hour, and you worked full time (40 hours a week) with no vacations, and you somehow managed to save all of that money and not spend a single cent of it, you would still have to work more than 25,000 years until you had as much wealth as Jeff Bezos.**

I've been researching this issue for years because I was shocked at just how bad it really is. I've come to the conclusion that there are underlying flaws in the system, and I've put together some information to help illustrate it.

**Quotes:**  

>**“No business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By workers I mean all workers, and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level, I mean the wages of decent living."** - Franklin Delano Roosevelt speaking about the minimum wage (it was always meant to be a living wage)

°

>**"The cause of poverty is not that we're unable to satisfy the needs of the poor, it's that we're unable to satisfy the greed of the rich."** - Anonymous

°

>**"Anyone who believes in indefinite growth on a physically finite planet is either a lunatic or an economist."** - Kenneth Boulding

°

>**"A century ago scarcity had to be endured; now it must be enforced."** - Murray Bookchin

°

>**"Capitalism as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of evils. I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion."** - Albert Einstein

°

>**"If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality."** - Stephen Hawking

**So, what do we do?**

I think the first step is spreading awareness and organizing people. Joining or creating local organizations is always good, and [unionizing is a great thing as well,](https://i.postimg.cc/N06BZt33/12731.jpg) and there are organizations like the IWW that can help you do that.

But honestly I think one of the best things we can focus on is to get behind [the only candidate who has been talking about these issues for decades.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=SYxZfksAyco) Although [the media is slandering him,](https://youtu.be/3ZhkKATtqtU) and [completely omitting him from their coverage,](https://imgur.com/a/VyNVA8D) he [actually has the most support,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/02/us/politics/2020-democratic-fundraising.html) and [especially amongst young people.](https://i.redd.it/ybarwig9v5u31.jpg)

As for his main competitor: Warren has some good campaign positions but [she didn't come up with them herself,](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/shes-got-a-borrowed-plan-for-that-the-media-myth-of-elizabeth-warren-the-wonk) and [she can't even be trusted to implement them](https://newrepublic.com/article/155756/elizabeth-warren-retreats-medicare) because [she's not honest](https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/463734-saagar-enjeti-calls-warrens-credibility-into-question) and [she's not actually a progressive.](https://medium.com/@jemtoback/the-legitimization-machine-elizabeth-warren-3d38a232e6eb) Also, [she can't even answer simple questions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d80FiQEU-Ok)

The public needs to get more involved in politics, and we need to demand that the system works for us, but I think it's important that we have a leader who actually cares about solving these problems because otherwise it's even more of an uphill battle. So register to vote as a democrat, vote for Bernie in the primaries, and get as many other people as you can to do the same. Subscribe to r/WayOfTheBern, r/OurPresident and r/SandersForPresident. And if you're willing and able to contribute money or time then please donate or volunteer for Bernie's campaign. An easy thing you can volunteer for is phonebanking, where you contact people and give them information. There are many things we can do to fix these problems, but the most important thing is to get the right person in the white house, and we have less than 100 days left now. This is not a drill, please get this information out there as much as you can and make sure that people know about these issues and know how to fix them. Thank you for your support, together we can do this!
